# Primo-VE-Normalization-Rules

This channel contains Display and Local fields normalization rules (NR) in use in swisscovery platform. 

The channel is divided in three section: 
- Network Zone: contains normalization rules distributed from the Network Zone (Local fields from 51 to 100).
- Instituzions Zones: contains normalization rules of the Display Fields and the Local fields from 1 to 50, which are manually implemented in every IZ because they can't be distributed
- Others: normalization rules for Local fields from 1 to 50, manually implemented only in some specific IZ.

Please note: Out-Of-the-Box normalization rules are a subject to change followed by Primo VE releases. The normalization rules published in this channel might not be the latest version published in Alma and thus, not relevant once a release becomes available.
